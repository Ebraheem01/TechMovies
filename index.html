        <p>
             <em> As we were growing in numbers, along with working on more exciting projects, we soon realized we should create an opportunity for our knowledge and new skills to be shared. We share knowledge differently, but we also organize tech talks in our office as we have a need to gather together and talk about the things we do or currently work on. These tech talks are also a great opportunity for our team building activities. Moreover, activities for creative and open-minded discussions and transfers of knowledge. You can start with bringing together people who want to share knowledge and give them an opportunity to share it. You will see that ground-breaking ideas aren’t merely possible – they are inevitable.</em>
